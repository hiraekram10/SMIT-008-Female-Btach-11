    <!-- A Promise is an Object that links Producing code and Consuming code.
     The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
 

     Async is multi-thread, which means operations or programs can run in parallel. Sync is a single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time
 
 A Promise is in one of these states:

pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed
     -->
<!-- The fetch() function returns a Promise which is fulfilled with a Response object representing the server's response. You can then check the request status and extract the body of the response in various formats, 
 including text and JSON, by calling the appropriate method on the response. -->
 What does 200 OK mean? The 200 OK status code means that the request was successful,
 
 404 page not found
 400 invalid syntax
